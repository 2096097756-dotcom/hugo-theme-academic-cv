role: Undergraduate Student @ SCGY
bio: |
  I am currently a freshman undergraduate student at the School of the Gifted Young (SCGY), University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
  
  With a strong passion for Physics, I maintained a GPA of 4.15/4.30 (Avg 93.21) during my first semester. I am currently in the phase of exploring various sub-fields of physics, such as Condensed Matter Physics and Quantum Information.

  My goal is to broaden my horizons by communicating with professors and researchers. I am also planning to take advanced courses in the "Four Mechanics" (Theoretical Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics) to build a solid theoretical foundation.
