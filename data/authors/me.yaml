role: Undergraduate Student @ SGY / 本科生于中国科学技术大学少年班学院
bio: |
  I am currently a freshman undergraduate student at the School of the Gifted Young (SGY), University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
  *   我目前是中国科学技术大学(USTC)少年班学院(SGY)的大一本科生。
  
  With a strong passion for Physics, I maintained a GPA of 4.15/4.30 (Avg 93.21) during my first semester. I am currently in the phase of exploring various sub-fields of physics, such as Condensed Matter Physics and Quantum Information.
  *   对物理学抱有浓厚热情，第一学期GPA为4.15/4.30(平均93.21)。我目前正在探索物理学的各个子领域,如凝聚态物理和量子信息。

  My goal is to broaden my horizons by communicating with professors and researchers. I am also planning to take advanced courses in the "Four Mechanics" (Theoretical Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics) to build a solid theoretical foundation.
  *   我的目标是通过与教授和研究人员沟通来开阔视野。我还计划学习"四大力学"(理论力学、电动力学、量子力学和统计力学)的高等课程，以建立扎实的理论基础。
